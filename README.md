# Windify - Weather Information Application

Welcome to Windify, a weather information application built with React. This application utilizes location permissions to access your current location and provide you with real-time weather information. Additionally, you can interact with the map canvas to obtain weather details for any chosen location by clicking on it, resulting in a marker that represents the selected location. There's a list of cards containing the weather information for the selected locations. What's more, you have the freedom to drag and position the marker to any desired location, and the weather card updates automatically to reflect the updated weather information. Alternatively you could use a search bar.

## Features

- Automatic Weather Information: Windify uses location permissions to retrieve your current location and generate the relevant weather data.
- Interactive Map: Click on any point in the map canvas to display the location's weather information and create a marker for reference.
- Dynamic Weather Cards: The left pane of the screen showcases weather information cards, dynamically updating with the latest data as you interact with its corresponding marker.

## How to Use

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that you grant the application location permissions when prompted. This will enable Windify to access your current location for accurate weather information.

2. **Interactive Map**: To know the weather information for any specific location, click on the desired spot in the map canvas. A marker will be added to indicate the selected location, and the corresponding weather data will be displayed in a card on the left side of the screen.

3. **Drag and Position Marker**: If you wish to explore weather information for a different location, simply drag the marker to the new location of interest. The weather card will automatically update to show the weather details for the newly selected location.

4. **Search box** : If you wish to explore the weather information by using the city name, you could do that as well.
